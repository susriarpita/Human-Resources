I have learnt here about Microsoft Power BI Which is a data and analytics reporting tool that helps organizations bring together disparate data sets into reporting dashboards. 
It aims to provide interactive visualizations and business intelligence capabilities with an interface simple enough for end users to create their own reports and dashboards.
Our group was given the data of a company’s Human Resources basis on total hire, total terminated, total salary. 
It’s applications was analyse employee turnover, find new employee information, find terminated employee information and analyse employee’s salary.
We analyzed the human resources of these basic facilities gender , age distribution by employee, headcount, supervisor level, length of employment,new hires & termination, dept.
wise new hires & termination, annual salary, pay analysis allotted each year .
Visualizations such as different bar graphs,pie chart, scatter graphs, key KPIs, multi row cards are used so that it becomes clearer for the user to understand it rather than
reading the whole thing down.
We have done  establish relationships among the data tables, clean and separate the data in order to use them in visualizations or else we would not be able to get the 
desired plot and found the relation between the two entities.
